# Multimodal Trajectory Prediction

This repository contains an implementation of a multimodal trajectory prediction model using the nuScenes dataset. The model combines visual, textual, and trajectory information to predict future trajectories of objects in autonomous driving scenarios.

## Features

- Multimodal fusion of vision, language, and trajectory data
- Pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) for image processing
- Pre-trained language model (BERT) for text processing
- End-to-end training pipeline
- Integration with Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- Support for nuScenes dataset

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multimodal-trajectory.git
cd multimodal-trajectory
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the nuScenes dataset:
- Visit [nuScenes website](https://www.nuscenes.org/)
- Download the dataset and extract it to the `datasets/nuscenes` directory

## Project Structure

```

## Usage

1. Configure the model and training parameters in `config.yaml`

2. Start training:
```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

The training script will:
- Load and preprocess the nuScenes dataset
- Initialize the multimodal model
- Train the model with the specified configuration
- Save checkpoints and best model
- Log metrics to Weights & Biases

## Model Architecture

The model consists of three main components:
1. Vision Encoder: Pre-trained ViT for processing camera images. The number of layers depends on the specific ViT model used (e.g., ViT-Base has 12 layers).
2. Language Encoder: Pre-trained BERT for processing scene descriptions. The number of layers depends on the specific BERT model used (e.g., BERT-Base has 12 layers).
3. Trajectory Encoder: MLP for processing past trajectory data. This encoder consists of two linear layers (with ReLU activations in between).

These features are fused together and passed through a decoder to predict future trajectories. The decoder consists of two linear layers (with a ReLU activation before the final layer).

## Configuration

Key parameters in `config.yaml`:
- Dataset settings (nuScenes version, paths, etc.)
- Model architecture (vision/language model choices)
- Training hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, etc.)
- Logging settings (Weights & Biases configuration)
